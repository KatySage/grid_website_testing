                        &emsp; A Wild Boar was sharpening his tusks busily against the stump of a tree, when a Fox happened by. Now the Fox was always looking for a chance to make fun of his neighbors. So he made a great show of looking anxiously about, as if in fear of some hidden enemy. But the Boar kept right on with his work.

                    <p>
                        &emsp; <em>"Why are you doing that?"</em> asked the Fox at last with a grin. <em>"There isn't any danger that I can see."</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;<em>"True enough," </em>replied the Boar, <em>"but when danger does come there will not be time for such work as this. My weapons will have to be ready for use then, or I shall suffer for it."</em>
